# Life Insurance Premium Calculator 💸

Welcome to the future of actuarial tools—built with R, powered by APIs, and served with a front-end flair.

## 🔍 What It Does
A insurance premium calculator that:
- Computes premiums for **Term, Whole Life, Endowment**, and **Pure Endowment** products
- Accepts user inputs for age, term, sum assured, and product type
- Returns clean, real-time premium values from the website and Render-hosted R API both

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **R & Plumber** for actuarial calculations and API creation
- **Docker & Render** for backend deployment
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend hosted via GitHub Pages
- **Git** for version control and CORS troubleshooting mastery

## 💡 Why I Built This
To make actuarial tools accessible to non-technical users—and to learn end-to-end deployment, cloud integration, and real-time API handling.
